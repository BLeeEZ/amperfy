// As an example, this class is set up to handle Message intents.
// You will want to replace this or add other intents as appropriate.
// The intents you wish to handle must be declared in the extension's Info.plist.

// You can test your example integration by saying things to Siri like:
// "Send a message using <myApp>"
// "<myApp> John saying hello"
// "Search for messages in <myApp>"

        // you can override this and return the handler you want for that particular intent.
