App Privacy Details on the Apple App Store

Google is committed to helping our customers create great iOS 14+ apps for end
users. The Apple App Store requires iOS 14+ app developers to provide App
Privacy Details. Starting with Cast iOS SDK version 4.6.0, privacy details
for a specific version of the SDK can be found in
GoogleCastSDK-ios-version_framework/NutritionLabel/NutritionLabel.txt
inside the Cast SDK framework. As privacy details may change from version to
version, be sure to check this file for the version you're building with.

While we will aim to be as transparent as possible in supporting you, we won’t
be able to speak for you, and you will ultimately be responsible for deciding
how to respond to Apple’s questionnaire and whether to show end users any
permissions or prompts described by Apple.

The Cast SDK automatically collects certain data by default, which Google uses
to monitor and improve the reliability and performance of the Cast SDK.

The Cast SDK collects the following data for all Cast apps:

* Diagnostic data

The Cast SDK collects certain data only if certain features are enabled or used:

* Device ID on every log upload. This is collected only if Analytics Logging
  has been enabled in the SDK.

* Usage data if the Cast SDK UI is used, including cast device selection
  and controlling media.

When answering Apple’s app privacy questions, the above data corresponds
to collecting the following types of data: Coarse location, Device Id,
Performance Data, and optionally, Product Interaction. This data is used
for Analytics and App Functionality.
